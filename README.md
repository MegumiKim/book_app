# BookJournal

<img src="./frontend/public/bookjournal.jpg" alt="project image" width="400" />

BookJournal is a full-stack personal project built with the MERN stack. The project is aimed at providing a platform for book enthusiasts to search, save, and write reviews for their favorite books.
Currently the bookshelf is shared by all users but the future plan includes expanding the project to support multiple users with authentication and review sharing functionality.

## Tech Stack

- **MongoDB**: Database for storing book and user data.
- **Express**: Web framework for building the backend.
- **React**: Frontend library for building the user interface.
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for server-side development.
- **DaisyUI**: UI components for a modern and responsive design.
- **TypeScript**: Strict syntactical superset of JavaScript for improved development.
